1. Run 'npm install'
2. Run 'npm run cypress' to open cypress gui.
3. Run 'npm run chrome' or 'npm run firefox' to run the test cases from cypress/e2e folder.

if you want to run only specific tests like sanity or regression and skip other tests, then add option [ --env grep='sanity' ] for scripts in package.json file and make sure your test suite name contains the keyword.
